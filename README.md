##Functionality
As a user, you should be able to:
- See profiles of all bots rendered.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the top division of the page. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the bottom division.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  top division.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "Discharge", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
